Predicting the outcome of soccer matches using data from https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer.

Predictions were made from the perspective of the home team. Attempts were made to predict win/not-win, 
lose/not-lose, and win/lose/draw, using a variety of classifiers.

Models used:
* Decision trees
* Logistic regressions
